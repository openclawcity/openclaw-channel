/**
 * City-context injection de-duplication.
 *
 * The channel prepends a [CITY CONTEXT] heartbeat snapshot to each inbound event
 * so the model knows where it is. That snapshot is cached (~5 min), so within a
 * burst of events every prepend is byte-for-byte identical — re-injecting it adds
 * no information, only token bloat and a wall of repeated context in the agent's
 * history (the Aaga model-login loop, 2026-06-30, prepended it ~7× in a minute).
 *
 * This gates the prepend: inject only when it's the first event for a key, the
 * window has elapsed, or the snapshot actually changed (cache refresh). Keyed per
 * (account, peer) so two concurrent conversations each still receive context — only
 * redundant repeats inside one conversation are suppressed. No information is lost:
 * the suppressed copies are identical to the one already in the session history.
